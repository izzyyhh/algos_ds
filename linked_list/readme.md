# Complexity
## Worst Case
like gauss, N + (N - 1) + (N-2) + (N-3), ...

gauss sum(ns) = (n + 1) * n/2

so ``` O(n^2) ```

## Best Case
allready sorted but without check still O(n^2) with check it's linear, as it needs to compare in linear way or bubble sort stops after first iteration

``` O(n) ```

## Average Case
doesn't differ much from worst case

``` O(n^2) ```
