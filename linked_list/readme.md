# Complexity
## Get
getting tail and head constant as saved  
``` O(1) ```  

getting node at index is linear as iteration
``` O(n) ```

## Insert
prepend and append constant time ``` O(1) ```
in the middle, linear as iteration plus setting references ```O(n) ```
## Delete
delete, shift and pop in constant time ``` O(1) ```  
in the middle linear time as iteration plus constant time ``` O(n) ```
