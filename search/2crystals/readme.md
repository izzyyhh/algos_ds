# Complexity
## Worst Case
dividing problem always into to halfs thus, log2(n)

so ``` O(log(n)) ```

## Best Case
when searched term is at the first computed middle index, thus constant

``` O(1) ```

## Average Case
doesn't differ much from worst case, just the count of how many times it needs to half the problem

``` O(log(n)) ```
